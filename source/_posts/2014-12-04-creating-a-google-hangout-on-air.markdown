I seem to have the magic sauce for creating a Hangout on air, so I wanted to share how I did it.

## 1. Log into the account you want to use for creating the Hangout

For this example I am using my corporate account to create the Hangout.  Open up any Google app (Gmail, Drive, etc.) and select the account switcher in the upper right:

![Account Switch](/assets/hangout_images/1_account_selection.png)
_Select the account you want to use for creating the Hangout._

## 2. Navigate to the Google+ page for your selected account

_Select the _View Profile_ button to be taken to the Google+ page_

## 3. Open the Hangouts page in Google+

![Open Hangouts Page](/assets/hangout_images/3_open_hangouts.gif)
_This menu is in the upper left corner of the page_

## 4. Click the _Start a Hangout On Air_ button

![Start Hangout](/assets/hangout_images/4_start_hangout.png)
_This button is located about halfway down the Hangouts page_

## 5. Enter your Hangout details

This is where you set the name and optionally the description.  Make sure _Opscode, Inc._ and _Public_ are in the Audience list at the bottom.  Mine defaults to having them.  You can always invite more audience members later.

If the hangout isn't supposed to start until later (Eg, for a post mortem) you can specify a different date by clicking the _Later_ button.

Click the _Share_ button when ready to create the hangout.  This will take you to the Hangout event page where you can manage it.

Click on the ![Links](/assets/hangout_images/5_links.png) button to see the Youtube link for viewers.

## 6.  Start Your Hangout

When ready click the blue `Start` button to start the hangout.

![Start Hangout](/assets/hangout_images/6_start_hangout.png)

You can invite people via the popup, but since the Hangout is public it should not be necessary.  Instead, I just copy and paste the hangout URL.  It should look like `https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYdnIM762XpHN0-hKUK-5CPW2tjucEk3eLZylFkKqCN864FvRA`.

Don't forget to click the ![Start Hangout](/assets/hangout_images/6_start_broadcast.png) button when you are ready to start recording.  The recording is automatically uploaded to Youtube once it is finished.  Users can view the event live using the Youtube link.
